# HPC-twitter-processing
Tasks for this project are:
1. Count	the	number	of	times	a	given	term	(word/string)	appears.

2. the	Tweeter (the	Twitter	user)	that	is	mentioned	the	most.	 A	Tweeter	is	prefixed	with	the @	
symbol,	e.g.	searching	for	“@rosinnott”	would	return	the	Tweets	that	mention	the	user	with	
Twitter	username	“rosinnott”.	This	search	should	list	the	top	10	most	mentioned	Tweeters,	
i.e.	 the	 top	 ten	 as	 ranked	 by	 the	 number	 of	 times	 their	 Twitter	 usernames occur in	 the	
twitter.csv	file.

3. the	topic	that	is	most	frequently	discussed.	Twitter	topics	are	prefixed	with	the	#	symbol,	e.g.	
searching	for	“#TonyAbbott”	would	return	Tweets	on	the	topic	of	“TonyAbbott”.	This	search	
should	include	the	top	10	topics	and	the	number	of	times	they	have	been	tweeted	about.
